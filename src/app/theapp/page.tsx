        <h1>URU_Space</h1>
        <p>
Strength training meets intelligent motion.
Welcome to URU_Space — a new ecosystem of performance tools that combine data precision with gestural communication.
We build tech that listens to your body in motion — and responds.
        </p>

<h2>What is URU_Wear?</h2>

<p>

URU_Wear is our first product line, designed to make strength training smarter, sharper, and more intuitive.
It combines:
URU_Tag – A 400Hz motion sensor that reads movement arcs, resistance, and form.
URU_Glove – Ergonomic, breathable gloves with a seamless design.
URU_App – A digital interface that speaks through data and gesture.
This is performance tech that feels as good as it performs.
    
</p>

<h2>Speak with Motion</h2>

<p>

Data is only half the story. URU adds motion language.
Our system communicates through visual gradients, haptic pulses, and LED signals — so you can adjust your form mid-set without looking at a screen.
Data Mode – Metrics, charts, progression logs
Gestural Mode – Colours, pulses, and flow-based feedback
URU lets you feel how you’re moving — and move better.

</p>

<h2>The URU_App</h2>

<p>

Your body. Your coach. Your feedback loop.
The URU_App captures every rep and responds with real-time coaching:
Tracks reps, sets, range of motion, resistance
Detects fatigue and adjusts intensity
Offers adaptive training plans powered by X-Packs — goal-based subscriptions for strength, mobility, or endurance

</p>


<h2>The URU_Tag</h2>

<p>

A new sensor for a new kind of training.
URU_Tag reads movement at 400Hz, syncing seamlessly with your glove and app.
It tracks:
Form quality
Time under tension
Movement efficiency
Then gives instant feedback — visually and physically.
No distractions. Just full-body awareness.
