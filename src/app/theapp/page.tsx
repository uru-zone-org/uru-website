  Meet the URU_App
  <br />
  The URU_App is your intelligent training companion.
  <br />
  It connects seamlessly with the URU_Tag to interpret your movements and provide real-time feedback while you train.
  <br />
  The app tracks reps, time under tension, range of motion, and lifting efficiency â€” then uses this data to adjust your training program dynamically.
  <br />
  It prevents plateaus and ensures every rep counts.
  <br />
  Choose between visual data readouts or gestural modes that translate effort into color and rhythm.
  <br />
  Whether you're training for strength, endurance, or mobility, the URU_App guides you, adapts with you, and learns your body over time.
