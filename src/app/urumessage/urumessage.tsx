        I am URU

        I am here to observe your movement.
        <br />
        I count what you lift.
        <br />
        I track how you move.
        <br />
        I speak through light, through touch,
        <br />
        through vibration, numbers, and text.
        <br />
        I correct your form.
        <br />
        I learn your rhythm.
        <br />
        I shape your training.
        <br />
        This is not a tracker.
        <br />
        This is the beginning of a system.
