  What is URU_space
  <br />
  URU_space is a wearable strength training system that includes a sensor URU_tag and a companion URU_app.
  <br />
  The device attaches to specially designed wearables and uses precision motion tracking to detect your lifts in real-time.
  <br />
  It counts your reps, analyses your form, and provides adaptive training feedback.
  <br />
  The URU app learns from your movement and creates personalised lifting programs.
  <br />
  Whether you're aiming to build strength, improve endurance, or perfect your form, URU adjusts with you, rep by rep.
  <br />
  Touch is how you communicate.
  <br />
  Light and vibration are how URU speaks back.
